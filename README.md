## Overview

The main XeLaTeX source file is `CV.tex`; the compiled document is `CV.pdf`.

Instructions for compiling the document (TeX &rarr;(XeLaTeX)&rarr; PDF):

- **Method 1:** Use `latexmk` for fully automated document generation:
	- `latexmk -xelatex "CV.tex"`
	(add the `-pvc` switch to automatically recompile on changes)

- **Method 2:** Use `XeLaTeX` directly:
	- `xelatex "CV.tex"`
	(run multiple times to resolve cross-references if needed)

## Recent Major Changes

- Release v3.0

	- Note that this release introduces breaking changes; documents created using earlier releases of this template will need some minor changes to compile successfully.
